# Git Workflow Documentation - Feature 9

## Professional Git Workflow Demonstration

### Workflow Steps Completed:

1. **Issue Identification**: Identified that 'set' command was missing from help menu
2. **Feature Branch Created**: `fix-help-command-bug`
3. **Code Fix Implemented**: Updated `builtins.c` to include 'set' command in help
4. **Testing**: Verified fix works correctly
5. **Branch Pushed**: fix-help-command-bug pushed to remote
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive workflow documentation
